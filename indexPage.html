        <h2> What is Formula 1?</h2>
        <P> Formula One, commonly abbreviated as F1, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars
            sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the 
            world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. 
            The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participants' cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a 
            series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits 
            or closed roads.</P>
